# MNIST-Autoencoding-and-Classification
Design autoencoding and classification models for the MNIST dataset. Train a convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct images and a classifier to predict digits. Explore the effects of small training datasets and transfer learning by comparing reconstruction and classification performance.
